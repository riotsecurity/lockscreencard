# Objective
Use these business cards for your physical security assessments or for your IT Security Awareness campaigns. \
Once you spot a workstation, which is unlocked and grants you access to the operating system, just place a card on the keyboard to noitify the user that locking the screen is important. This method is much less invasive than leaving a virtual message on the workstation itself. \
We have added print ready images and GIMP project files to this repository (German and English) so that you can either use our design or create something completely new.
